                        <p>Hi! I'm Yer, FOOD EXTRAORDINAIRE. There's no simpler way to put it, other than I ‚ù§Ô∏è food. My Saturday morning cartoons have turned into Saturday morning cooking shows. I grew up with the classics like "Baking with Julia," "Martha Stewart," and one of my all time PBS favorites, "Martin Yan Can Cook!" Nowadays, the new thing has been competitive cooking shows and I'm loving it. I am a huge "Beat Bobby Flay" fan. I'm always cheering for him to lose, just to end up amazed at how he could have possibly pulled off a win with a dish that he'd never cooked before.</p>                     
                        <p>But my favorite thing about food, is EATing it! I love everything from pasta to burgers, and soups to salads and DESSERT! I don't have a sweet tooth, except for when it comes to chocolate. On my birthday, I ALWAYS get chocolate cake. As you can see from my photo, I also love a good messy burger. If you're not mopping yourself up at the end, then it wasn't a good burger (ya know what I mean?!).</p>
                        <p>I have no known allergies so I'll basically eat everything. Or I'll at least give everything a try. There aren't many known foods out there that I won't eat. There's a live octopus dish in South Korea that's been calling my name. Let me know what weird foods I should try!</p>
