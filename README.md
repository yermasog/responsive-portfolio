# responsive-portfolio
A portfolio that uses Bootstrap for responsiveness to better accommodate mobile devices. 

I used Bootstrap v4.5 for some of my components like the nav bar and contact form. Bootstrap is a good beginners' tool for responsiveness since it's built into the components. 

The website should automatically format/respond to the screen size and adjust accordingly.
